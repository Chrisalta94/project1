        Tokyo's most famous landmark, the Imperial Palace with its beautiful
        17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats, is a must-see when
        visiting the nation's capital. Don't be put off by the fact that the
        majority of the palace is closed to the public (it's still in use by the
        Imperial family), as there is still enough to see simply by strolling
        the grounds.

      <br />In addition to the many fine views of the palace from numerous
      points in the surrounding parkland, visitors are permitted into the East
      Higashi-Gyoen Garden and other areas that are opened to the public as part
      of an organized tour. One of the most romantic views is of the famous
      Nijubashi Bridge, or "double bridge," so named for its watery reflection.
      <br />
      <br />Another one of the must-sees for tourists visiting Tokyo is the
      famous Ginza shopping district. This always bustling area is home to the
      Kabuki-za Theatre with its Kabuki performances, as well as the Shimbashi
      Enbujo Theatre with its traditional Azuma-odori dances and Bunraku
      performances.
