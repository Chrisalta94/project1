    <h1>Japan</h1>
    <p class="intro_para">
      <i>Japan</i>, a nation in East Asia, is an archipelago of 6,852 islands in
      the Pacific Ocean. It is a constitutional monarchy, with Tokyo as its
      capital. More than 99% of the population speaks Japanese. The economy of
      Japan is the third largest in the world after the United States and the
      People's Republic of China.

          Sensō-ji is an ancient Buddhist temple located in Asakusa, Tokyo,
          Japan. It is Tokyo's oldest temple, and one of its most significant.
          Formerly associated with the Tendai sect of Buddhism, it became
          independent after World War II. Adjacent to the temple is a five-story
          pagoda, the Asakusa Shinto shrine, as well as many shops with
          traditional goods in the Nakamise-dōri. The Sensoji Kannon temple is
          dedicated to Kannon Bosatsu, the Bodhisattva of compassion, and is the
          most widely visited spiritual site in the world with over 30 million
          visitors annually. The temple has a titanium tiled roof that maintains
          the historic image but is stronger and lighter.

          Sunayama is situated in the north of Miyako-jima Island which is part
          of Japan's tropical Okinawa Prefecture. This pleasant little white
          sand beach is immediately identifiable by the rock arch at the
          southern end of the beach. The arch was formed by the exposed coral
          reef being eroded by the sea over the centuries.

        SkyDrive CEO Tomohiro Fukuzawa wants Japan residents to spend their time
        doing what they love, and that means cutting down idle time such as
        commuting. The next step for transportation, Fukuzawa explains, is to
        separate ourselves from restraining land infrastructure and look to the
        airspace around us. “In 50 years, people will want to move freely,” he
        says. And the best way to do that, he believes, is to introduce flying
        cars.
